# Learning Outcome
Knowledge about used theory, common practice and method withn programming architecture, including technics and method within developing of applications. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to test your knowledge about the first learning outcome described above. You will be tested in your knowledge of theory and common practices within programming architecture. If you cannot answer these question write pass. 
## Goals
This branch gives you an indication of wether you have the required knowledge about application developement and thereby what you should focus on, if you do not know the answers.
